# Recommendation Systems in Rust

This repo is just for my own learning on the subject of recommendation systems and algorithms. Nothing is garuanteed to be production quality and error-tolerant and may not be the most performant. 

## Some Goals:

1. Matrix factorization technique with regularization. (Done)
2. Shifted cosine similarity (Not yet).
